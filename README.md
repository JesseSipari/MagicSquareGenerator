# Magic Square Generator

This is a C++ project for generating magic squares of various sizes. It was created as a learning exercise to practice C++ programming and explore the algorithms behind magic squares.

## Features

- Generates odd, doubly even, and hopefully soon singly even magic squares
- Input validation for square size
- Simple console output of the generated square

## Usage

1. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter the desired size for the magic square (between 3 and 99).

## Motivation

I made this project to learn some C++. I learned about Magic squares, and they seemed interesting, providing a fun way to practice algorithms and data structures in C++.
